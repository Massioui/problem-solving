Task: Implement a function to perform an in-order traversal of a binary tree and return the nodes in sorted order.

 Explanation:
 * In-order traversal is a method used to visit all the nodes of a binary tree in a ascending order.
 * In this traversal, nodes are visited in the order of: left child --> current node --> right child.
 * For a binary search tree (BST), an in-order traversal will visit nodes in ascending order of their values.
 * The goal is to implement a function that performs this traversal and returns the nodes in sorted order, effectively producing a sorted list of values from the tree.

 Given:
         (4)
        /   \
      (1)    (6)
     /  \      \
   (2)  (5)    (7)

 This binary tree represents the following structure:
 * Root node: Value 4
   * Left child of the root: Value 1
     * Left child of node 1: Value 2
     * Right child of node 1: Value 5
   * Right child of the root: Value 6
     * Left child of node 6: Value 7

 * Expected output of in-order traversal: 2, 1, 5, 4, 6, 7
